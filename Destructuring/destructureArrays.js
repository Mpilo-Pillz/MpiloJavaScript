console.log(`I started coding by learning ${firstProgrammingLanguage}, but I never got deep into it. ${strongest} is my strongest framework. I started being aware whiles learning ${awakening}. However I have more professional experience with ${experienced}.

${dearest} holds a special place in my heart as it taught me backend, however ${gateway} will teach me the design patterns used in the industry. I think ${mvpl} will be my most valuable programming language
Lets never forget that ${paidBills} paid the bills for almost a year but I worte my first functioning tool in ${firstUsefulTool}. I can test what i build using ${testAutomation}
